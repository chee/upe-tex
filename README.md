# upe-tex / upe-txt

i found these files on my computer. i don't know where they came from. they
appear to be (partially incomplete) <b>L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</b> source
for the [Unix Programming
Environment](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/unix-programming-environment-the/P200000000349/9780139376818
"buy now").

i can't find these files anywhere else, so i'm uploading them here. anyone want
to help me finish them?
