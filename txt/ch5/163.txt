This silence is unexpected, and wrong. It happens because if ls can't find a
file, it reports the problem on its standard output, before printing any
information about existing files. This is undeniably a bug --- the diagnostic
should be printed on the standard error --- but we can get around it by
recognizing the problem in the loop and redirecting the standard error to
standard output so all versions work the same. (This problem has been fixed in
newer versions of the system, but we've left it as is to illustrate how you can
often cope with minor botches.)

        $ cat news
        # news:  print news files, version 2

        HOME=.          # debugging only
        cd .            # place holder for /usr/news
	IFS='
	'		# just a newline
        for i in `ls -t * $HOME/.news_time 2>&1`
        do
                case $i in
		*' not found')  ;;
                */.news_time)   break ;;
                *)              echo news: $i ;;
                esac
        done
        touch $HOME/.news_time

We must set IFS to newline so the message

        ./.news_time not found

is not parsed as three words.

news must next print the news files, rather than echoing their names. It's
useful to know who posted a message and when, so we use the set command and ls
-l to print a header before the message itself:
