        $ ls -l news
        -rwxrwxrwx 1 you         208 Oct  1 12:05 news
        $ set `ls -l news`
        -rwxrwxrwx: bad option(s)               Something is wrong!

Here is one example where the interchangeability of program and data in the
shell gets in the way. set complains because its argument ("-rwxrwxrwx") begins
with a minus sign and thus looks like an option. An easy (if inelegant) fix is
to prefix the argument by an ordinary character:

        $ set X`ls -l news`
        $ echo "news: ($3) $5 $6 $7"
        news: (you) Oct 1 12:05
        $

This is a reasonable format, showing the author and date the message along with
the filename.

Here is the final version of the news command:

        # news:  print news files, final version

        PATH=/bin:/usr/bin
        IFS='
        '                       # just a newline
        cd /usr/news

        for i in `ls -t * $HOME/.news_time 2>&1`
        do
                IFS=' '
                case $i in
                *' not found')  ;;
                */.news_time)   break ;;
                *)      set X`ls -l $i`
                        echo "
        $i: ($3) $5 $6 $7
        "
                        cat $i
                esac
        done
        touch $HOME/.news_time

The extra newlines in the header separate the news items as they are
printed. The first value of IFS is just a newline, so the not found message (if
any) from the first ls treated as a single argument. The second assignment to
IFS resets it to a blank, so the output of the second ls is split into multiple
arguments.

Exercise 5-27. Add an option -n (Notify) to news to report but not print the
news items, and not touch .news_time. This might be placed in your .profile.
