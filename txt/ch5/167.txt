There will clearly be trouble if the file we are modifying contains lines
beginning with a triple at-sign, and the BUGS section of diff(1) warns about
lines that contain only a period. We chose @@@ to mark the editing commands
because it's an unlikely sequence for normal text.

Although it might be instructive to show how the get and put commands evolved,
they are relatively long and showing their various forms would require too much
discussion. We will therefore show you only their finished forms. put is
simpler:

        # put:  install file into history

        PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

        case $# in
                1)  HIST=$1.H ;;
                *)  echo 'Usage: put file' 1>&2; exit 1 ;;
        esac
        if test ! -r $1
        then
                echo "put: can't open $1" 1>&2
                exit 1
        fi
        trap 'rm -f /tmp/put.[ab]$$; exit 1' 1 2 15
        echo -n 'Summary: '
        read Summary

        if get -o /tmp/put.a$$ $1               # previous version
        then                    # merge pieces
                cp $1 /tmp/put.b$$              # current version
                echo "@@@ `getname` `date` $Summary" >>/tmp/put.b$$
                diff -e $1 /tmp/put.a$$ >>/tmp/put.b$$  # latest diffs
                sed -n '/^@@@/,$p' <$HIST >>/tmp/put.b$$ # old diffs
                overwrite $HIST cat /tmp/put.b$$        # put it back
        else                    # make a new one
                echo "put: creating $HIST"
                cp $1 $HIST
                echo "@@@ `getname` `date` $Summary" >>$HIST
        fi
        rm -f /tmp/put.[ab]$$

After reading the one-line summary, put calls get to extract the previous
version of the file from the history file. The -o option to get specifies an
alternate output file. If get couldn't find the history file, it returns an
error status and put creates a new history file. If the history file does exist,
the then clause creates the new history in a temporary file from, in order, the
newest version, the @@@ line, the editor commands to convert from the newest
version to the previous, and the old editor commands and @@@ lines. Finally, the
temporary file is copied onto the history file using overwrite.
