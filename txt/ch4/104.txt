The regular expressions interpreted by egrep (also listed in Table 4.1) are the
same as in grep, with a couple of additions. Parentheses can be used to group,
so (xy)* matches any of the empty string, xy, xyxy, xyxyxy and so on. The
vertical bar | is an "or" operator; today|tomorrow matches either today or
tomorrow, as does to(day|morrow). Finally, there are two other closure operators
in egrep, + and ?. The pattern x+ matches one or more x's, and x? matches zero
or one x, but no more.

egrep is excellent at word games that involve searching the dictionary for words
with special properties. Our dictionary is Webster's Second International, and
is stored on-line as the list of words, one per line, without definitions. Your
system may have /usr/dict/words, a smaller dictionary intended for checking
spelling; look at it to check the format. Here's a pattern to find words that
contain all five vowels in alphabetical order:

        $ cat alphvowels
        ^[^aeiou]*a[^aeiou]*e[^aeiou]*i[^aeiou]*o[^aeiou]*u[^aeiou]*$
        $ egrep -f alphvowels /usr/dict/web2 | 3
        abstemious               abstemiously              abstentions
        acheilous                acheirous                 acleistous
        affectious               annelidous                arsenious
        arterious                bacterious                caesious
        facetious                facetiously               fracedinous
        majestious
        $

The pattern is not enclosed in quotes in the file alphvowels. When quotes are
used to enclose egrep patterns, the shell protects the commands from
interpretation but strips off the quotes; egrep never sees them. Since the file
is not examined by the shell, however, quotes are not used around its
contents. We could have used grep for this example, but because of the way egrep
works, it is much faster when searching for patterns that include closures,
especially when scanning large files.

As another example, to find all words of six or more letters that have the
letters in alphabetical order:

        $ cat monotonic
        ^a?b?c?d?e?f?g?h?i?j?l?m?n?o?p?q?r?s?t?u?v?w?x?y?z?$
        $ egrep -f monotonic /usr/dict/web2 | grep '......' | 5
        abdest        acfcnow       adipsy        agnosy        almost
        bedfist       behint        befcnow       bijoux        biopsy
        chintz        dehors        dehort        demos         dimpsy
        egilops       ghosty
        $

(Egilops is a disease that attacks wheat.) Notice the use of grep to filter the
output of egrep.
