comfortable programming environment.

So although UNIX has begun to show some signs of middle age, it's still viable
and still gaining in popularity. And that popularity can be traced to the clear

programming environment they would find comfortable. Although they didn't expect
their system to spread to tens of thousands of computers, a generation of
programmers is glad that it did.
