History and bibliographic notes

There is no detailed description of the UNIX system implementation, in part
because the code is proprietary. Ken Thompson's paper "UNIX implementation"
(BSTJ, july, 1978) describes the basic ideas. Other papers that discuss related
topics are "The UNIX system --- a retrospective" in the same issue of BSTJ, and
"The evolution of the UNIX time-sharing system" (Symposium on Language Design
and Programming Methodology, Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science
#79, 1979.) Both are by Dennis Ritchie.

The program readslow was invented by Peter Weinberger, as a low-overhead way for
spectators to watch the progress of Belle, Ken Thompson and Joe Condon's chess
machine, during chess tournaments. Belle recorded the status of its game in a
file; onlookers polled the file with readslow so as not to steal too many
precious cycles from Belle. (The newest version of the Belle hardware does
little computing on its host machine, so the problem has gone away.)

Our inspiration for spname comes from Tom Duff. A paper by Ivor Durham, David
Lamb and James Saxe entitled "Spelling correction in user interfaces," CACM,
October, 1983, presents a somewhat different design for spelling correction, in
the context of a mail program.
