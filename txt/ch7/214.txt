this can happen with the current version.

Exercise 7-6. The name tx matches whichever of tc happens to come last in the
directory, for any single character c. Can you invent a better distance measure?
Implement it and see how well it works with real users.

Exercise 7-7. mindist reads the directory one entry at a time. Does p run
perceptibly faster if directory reading is done in bigger chunks?

Exercise 7-8. Modify spname to return a name that is a prefix of the desired
name if no closer match can be found. How should ties be broken if there are
several names that all match the prefix?

Exercise 7-9. What other programs could profit form spname? Design a standalone
program that would apply correction to its arguments before passing them along
to another program, as in

        $ fix prog filenames...

Can you write a version of cd that uses spname? how would you install it?


7.3 File system: inodes

In this section we will discuss system calls that deal with the file system and
in particular with the information about files, such as size, dates,
permissions, and so on. These system calls allow you to get at all the
information we talked about in Chapter 2.

Let's dig into the inode itself. Part of the inode is described by a structure
called stat, defined in <sys/stat.h>:

        struct stat /* structure returned by stat */
        {
            dev_t st_dev;    /* device of indoe */
            ino_t st_ino;    /* indoe number */
            short st_mode;   /* mode bits */
            short st_nlink;  /* number of links to file */
            short st_uid;    /* owner's userid */
            short st_gid;    /* owner's group id */
            dev_t st_rdev;   /* for special file */
            off_t st_size;   /* file size in characters */
            time_t st_atime; /* time file last read */
            time_t st_mtime; /* time file last written or created */
            time_t st_ctime; /* time file or inode last changed */
        };


Most of the fields are explained by the comments. Types like dev_t and ino_t are
defined in <sys/types.h>, as discussed above. The st_mode entry contains a set
of flags describing the file; for convenience, the flag definitions are also
part of the file <sys/stat.h>:
