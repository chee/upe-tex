such character has a name that is either \c where c is a single character, or
\(cd where cd is a pair of characters.

troff prints an ASCII minus sign as a hyphen - rather than a minus -. A true
minus must be typed \- and a dash must be typed \(em, which stands for "em
dash," the character "---".

Table 9.3 lists some of the most common special characters; there are many more
in the troff manual (and the list may be different on your system).

There are times when troff must be told not to interpret a character, especially
a backslash or a leading period. The two most common "hands-off" characters are
\e and \&. The sequence \e is guaranteed to print as a backslash, uninterpreted,
and is used to get a backslash in the output. \&, on the other hand, is nothing
at all: it is a zero-width blank. Its main use is to prevent troff from
interpreting periods at the beginning of lines. We used \e and \& a lot in this
chapter. For example, the ms outline at the beginning of this chapter was typed
as

	\&.TL
	.I "Title of document"
	\&.AU
	.I "Author name"
	\&.AB
	\&...
