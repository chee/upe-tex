There are several other programs to help with document preparation. The refer(1)
command looks up references by keywords and installs in your document the
in-line citations and a reference section at the end. By defining suitable
macros, you can arrange that refer print references in the particular style you
want. There are existing definitions for a variety of computer science
journals. refer is part of the 7th Edition, but has not been picked up in some
other versions.

pic(1) and ideal(1) do for pictures what eqn does for equations. Pictures are
significantly more intricate than equations (at least to typeset), and there is
not oral tradition of how to talk about pictures, so both languages take some
work to learn and to use. To give the flavor of pic, here is a simple picture
and its expression in pic.

The pictures in this book were all done with pic. pic and ideal are not part of
the 7th Edition but are now available.

refer, pic and ideal are all troff preprocessors. There are also programs to
examine and comment on the prose in your documents. The best known of these is
spell(1), which reports on possible spelling errors in files; we used it
extensively. style(1) and diction(1) analyze punctuation, grammar and language
usage. These in turn developed into the Writer's Workbench, a set of programs to
help improve writing style. The Writer's Workbench program are good at
identifying cliches, unnecessary words and sexist phrases.

spell is standard. The others may be on your system; you can easily find out by
using man:
