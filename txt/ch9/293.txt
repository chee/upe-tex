|				    ABSTRACT				       |
|									       |
|       Hoc is a simple programmable interpreter for flating point expres-     |
|       sions. It has C-style control flow, function definition and the usual  |
|       numerical built-in functions such as cosine and logarithm.	       |

|									       |
|    Hoc is an expression language, much like C: although there are several    |
| control-flow statements, most statements such as assignments are expressions |
| whose value is disregarded.						       |

Displays

Although it is usually convenient that troff fills and justifies text, sometimes
that isn't desirable --- programs, for example, shouldn't have their margins
adjusted. Such unformatted material is called display text. The ms command .DS
F(display start) and .DE (display end) demarcate text to be printed as it
appears, indented but without rearrangement. Here is the next portion of the hoc
manual, which includes a short display:

	.PP
	.I Hoc
	is an expression language,
	much like C:
	although there are several control-flow statements,
	most statements such as assignments
	are expressions whose value is disregarded.
	For example, the assignment operator
	= assigns the value of its right operand
	to its left operand, and yields the value,
	so multiple assignments work.
	The expression grammar is:
