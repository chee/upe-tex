        is a simple programmable interpreter
        for floating point expressions.
        It has C-style control flow,
        function definition and the usual
        numerical built-in functions
        such as cosine and logarithm.

        .I Hoc
        is an expression language,
        much like C:
        although there are several control-flow statements,
        most statements such as assignments
        are expressions whose value is disregarded.

This .I command italicizes its argument, or switches to italic if no argument is
given.

If you use a macro package, it's specified as an argument to troff:

        $ troff -ms hoc.ms

The characters after the -m determine the macro package.+ When formatted with
ms, the hoc paper looks like this:


----------------
+ The ms macros are in the file /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.s, and the man macros are in
/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.an.
