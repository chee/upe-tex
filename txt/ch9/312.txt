An example should clarify how to write the manual page. The source for hoc(1),
/usr/man/man1/hoc.1, is shown in Figure 9.1, and Figure 9.2 is the output of

        $ man -t hoc


Exercise 9-8. Write a manual page for doctype. Write a version of the man
command that looks in your own man directory for documentation on your personal
programs.

|SYNOPSIS                                                                      |

|DESCRIPTION                                                                   |
|       Hoc  interprets  a  simple  language  for floating point arithmetic, at|
|       about the level of BASIC, with C-like syntax and functions  and  proce-|
|       dures with arguments and recursion.                                    |
|                                                                              |
|       The named files are read and interpreted in order.  If no file is given|
|       or if file is '-' hoc interprets the standard input.                   |
|                                                                              |
|       Hoc input consists of  expressions  and  statements.   Expressions  are|
|       evaluated and their results printed.  Statements, typically assignments|
|       and function or procedure definitions, produce no  output  unless  they|
|       explicitly call print.                                                 |
