        $ man 7 man

prints only the description of the macros. The default action is to print all
pages with the specified name, using nroff, but man -t generates typeset pages
using troff.

The author of a manual page creates a file in the proper subdirectory of
/usr/man. The man command calls nroff or troff with a macro package to print the
page, as we can see by searching the man command for formatter invocations. Our
result would be

        $ grep roff `which man`
                nroff $opt -man $all ;;
                neqn $all | nroff $opt -man ;;
                troff $opt -man $all ;;
                troff -t $opt -man $all | tc ;;
                eqn $all troff $opt -man ;;
                eqn $all troff -t $opt -man | tc ;;
        $

The variety is to deal with options: nroff vs. troff, whether or not to run eqn,
etc. The manual macros, invoked by troff -man, define troff commands that format
in the style of the manual. They are basically the same as the ms macros, but
there are differences, particularly in setting up the title and in the font
change commands. The macros are documented --- briefly --- in man(7), but the
basics are easy to remember. The layout of a manual page is:

        .TH COMMAND section-number
        .SH NAME
        command \- brief description of function
        .SH SYNOPSIS
        .B command
        options
        .SH DESCRIPTION
        Detailed explanation of programs and options.
        Paragraphs are introduced by .PP.
        .PP
        This is a new paragraph.
        .SH FILES
        Files used by the command, e.g., passwd(1) mentions /etc/passwd
        .SH "SEE ALSO."
        References to related command, including other manual pages
        .SH DIAGNOSTICS
        Description of any unusual output (e.g., see cmp(1))
        .SH BUGS
        Surprising features (not always bug; see below)

If any section is empty, its header is omitted. The .TH line and the NAME,
SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION sections are mandatory.
