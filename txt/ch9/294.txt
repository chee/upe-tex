|    Hoc is an expression language, much like C: although there are several    |
| control-flow statements, most statements such as assignments are expressions |
| whose value is disregarded. For example, the assignment operator = assigns   |
| the value of its right operand to its left operand, and yields the value, so |
| multiple assignments work. The expression grammar is:                        |
|                                                                              |

Text inside a display is not normally filled or justified. Furthermore, if there
is not enough room on the current page, the displayed material (and everything
that follows it) is moved onto the next page. .DS permits several options,
including L for left-justified, C, which centers each line individually, and B,
which centers the entire display.

The items in the display above are separated by tabs. By default, troff tabs are
set every half inch, not every eight spaces as is usual. Even if tab stops were
every 8 spaces, though, characters are of varying widths, so tabs processed by
troff wouldn't always appear as expected.


Font changes

The ms macros provide three commands to change the font. .R changes the font to
roman, the usual font, .I changes to italic, this font, and .B changes to
boldface, this font. Unadorned, each command selects the font for subsequent
text:
