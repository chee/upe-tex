        \e&.TL
        \&.I "Title of document"
        \e&.AU
        ...

and you can imagine how that in turn was typed.

Another special character that turns up occasionally is the unpaddable blank, a
\ followed by a blank. Normally, troff will stretch an ordinary blank to align
the margins, but an unpaddable blank is never adjusted: it is like any other
character and has a fixed width. It can also be used to pass multiple words as a
single argument:

        .I Title\ of\ document


Font and size changes

Most font and format changes can be done with the beginning-of-line macros like
.I, but sometimes changes must be made in-line. In particular, the newline
character is a word separator, so if a font change must be made in the middle of
the word, the macros are unusable. This subsection discusses how troff overcomes
this problem --- note that it is troff that provides the facility, not the ms
macro package.

troff uses the backslash character to introduce in-line commands. The two most
common commands are \f to change font and \s to change point size.

The font is specified with \f by a character immediately after the f:
