The mm macro package

We won't go into any detail on the mm macro package here, since it is in spirit
and often in detial very similar to ms. It provides more control of parameters
than ms does, more capabilities (e.g., automatically numbered lists), and better
error messages. Table 9.2 shows the mm commands equivalent to the ms commands in
Table 9.1.

Exercise 9-1. Omitting a terminating command like .AE or .DE is usually a
disaster. Write a program mscheck to detect errors in ms input (or your favorite
package). Suggestion: awk.



9.2 The troff level

In real life, one sometimes has to go beyond the facilities of ms, mm or other
packages to get at some capability of bare troff. Doing so is like programming
in assembly language, however, so it should be done cautiously and reluctantly.

Three situations arise: access to special characters, in-line size and font
changes, and a few basic formatting functions.


Character names

Access to strange characters --- Greek letters like PI, graphics like bullet and
dagger, and a variety of lines and spaces --- is easy, though not very
systematic. Each
