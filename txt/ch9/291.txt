commands. The first consists of a period at the beginning of a line, followed by
one or two letters or digits, and perhaps by parameters, as illustrated here:

        .PP
	.ft B
	This is a little bold font paragraph.

troff built-in commands all have lower-case names, so by convention commands in
macro packages are given upper-case names. In this example, .PP is the ms
command for a paragraph, and .ft B is a troff command that causes a change to
the bold font. (Fonts have upper case names; the fonts available may be
different on different typesetters.)

The second form of troff command is a sequence of characters that begins with a
backslash \, and may appear anywhere in the input; for example, \fB also causes
a switch to the bold font. This form of command is pure troff; we'll come back
to it shortly.

You can format with nothing more than a .PP command before each paragraph, and
for most documents, you can get by with about a dozen different ms commands. For
example, Appendix 2, which describes hoc, has a title, the author's name, an
abstract, automatically-numbered sections headings, and paragraphs. It uses only
14 distinct commands, several of which come in pairs. The paper talks this
general form in ms:

	.TL
	Title of document (one or more lines)
	.AU
	Author names, one per line
	.AB
	Abstract, terminated by .AE
	.AE
	.NH
	Numbered heading (automatic numbering)
	.PP
	Paragraph ...
	.PP
	Another Paragraph ...
	.SH
	Sub-heading (not numbered)
	.PP
	...

Formatting commands must occur at the beginning of a line. Input between the
commands is free form: the location of newlines in the input is unimportant,
because troff moves words from line to line to make lines long enough (a process
called filling), and spreads extra space uniformly between words to align the
margins (justification). It's a good practice, however, to start each sentence
on a new line; it makes subsequent editing easier.

Here is the beginning of the actual hoc document:
