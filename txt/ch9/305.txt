mathematical characters have names, such as sum, int, infinity, grad: sum, int,
infinity, grad. There are positional operators such as sub, sup, from, to, and
over:


is

        sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i sup 2 ~->~ l over {2 pi}

There are operators like sqrt and expandable parentheses, braces, etc. eqn will
also create columns and matrices of objects. There are also commands to control
sizes, fonts and positions when the defaults are not correct.

It is common to place small mathematical expressions such as log_10(x) in the
body of the text, rather than in displays. The eqn keyword delim specifies a
pair of characters to bracket in-line expressions. The characters used as left
and right delimiters are usually the same; often a dollar sign $ is used. But
since hoc uses $ for arguments, we use @ in our examples. % is also a suitable
delimiter, but avoid the others: so many characters have special properties in
the various programs that you can get spectacularly anomalous behaviors. (We
certainly did as we wrote this chapter.)

So, after saying

.EQ
delim @@
.EN

in-line expressions such as [sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i] can be printed:

        in-line expressions 
        such as @sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i@ can be printed:

In-line expressions are used for mathematics within a table, as this example
from the hoc document shows:

columns. The output appears below.
