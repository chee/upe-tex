        .SH NAME
        hoc \- interactive floating point language
        .SH SYNOPSIS
        .B hoc
        [ file ... ]
        .SH DESCRIPTION
        .I Hoc
        interprets a simple language for floating point arithmetic,
        at about the level of BASIC, with C-like syntax and
        functions and procedures with arguments and recursion.
        .PP
        The named
        .IR files
        are read and interpreted in order.
        If no
        .I file
        is given or if
        .I file
        is '\-'
        .I hoc
        interprets the standard input.
        .PP
        .I Hoc
        input consists of
        .I expressions
        and
        .IR statements .
        Expressions are evaluated and their results printed.
        Statements, typically assignments and function or procedure
        definitions, produce no output unless they explicitly call
        .IR print .

        .SH BUGS
        Error recovery is imperfect within function and procedure definitions.
        .br
        The treatment of newlines is not exactly user-friendly.

variations of the command's normal behavior. The BUGS section is also somewhat
misnamed. Defects reported here aren't so much bugs as shortcomings --- simple
bugs should be fixed before the command is installed. To get a feeling for what
goes in the DIAGNOSTICS and BUGS sections, you might browse through the standard
manual.
