        $ time awk '... doctype without egrep ...' ch9.*
        cat ch9.1 ch9.2 ch9.3 ch9.4 | pic | tbl | eqn | troff -ms

        real       31.0
        user        8.9
        sys         2.8
        $ time doctype ch9*
        cat ch9.1 ch9.2 ch9.3 ch9.4 | pic | tbl | eqn | troff -ms

        real        7.0
        user        1.0
        sys         2.3
        $

The comparison is evidently in favor of the version using three processes. (This
was done on a machine with only one user; the ratio of real times would favor
the egrep version even more on a heavily loaded system.) Notice that we did get
simple working version first, before we started to optimize.


Exercise 9-2. How did we format this chapter?

Exercise 9-3. If your eqn delimiter is a dollar sign, how do you get a dollar
sign in the output? Hint: investigate quotes and the pre-defined words of eqn.

Exercise 9-4. Why doesn't

        $ `doctype filenames`

work? Modify doctype to run the resulting command, instead of printing it?

Exercise 9-5. Is the overhead of the extra cat in doctype important? Rewrite
doctype to avoid the extra process? Which version is simpler?

Exercise 9-6. Is it better to use doctype or to write a shell file containing
the commands to format a specific document?

Exercise 9-7. Experiment with various combinations of grep, egrep, fgrep, sed,
awk and sort to create the fastest possible version of doctype.



9.4 The manual page

The main documentation for a command is usually the manual page --- a one-page
description in the UNIX Programmer's Manual. (See Figure 9.2) The manual page is
stored in a standard directory, usually /usr/man, in a sub-directory numbered
according to the section of the manual. Our hoc manual page, for example,
because it describes a user command, is kept in /usr/man/man1/hoc.1.

Manual pages are printed with the main(1) command, a shell file that runs nroff
-man, man hoc prints the hoc manual. If the same name appears in more than one
section, as does man itself (Section 1 describes the command, while Section 7
describes the macros), the section can be specified to man:
