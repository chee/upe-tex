        This text is roman, but
        .I
        this text is italic,
        .R
        this is roman again, and
        .B
        this is boldface.

appears like this:

        This text is roman, but this text is italic, this is roman again, and
        this is boldface.

.I and .B take optional argument, in which case the font change applies only to
the argument. In troff, arguments containing blanks must be quoted, although the
only quoting character is the double quote "

        This is roman, but
        .I this
        is italic, and
        .B "these words"
        are bold.

is printed as

        This is roman, but this is italic, and these words are bold.

Finally, a second argument to .I or .B is printed in roman, appended without
spaces to the first argument. This feature is most commonly used to produce
punctuation in the right font. Compare the last parenthesis of

        (parenthetical
        .I "italic words)"

which print incorrectly as

        (parenthetical italic words)

with

        (parenthetical
        .I "italic words" )

which prints correctly as

        (parenthetical italic words)

Font distinctions are recognized by nroff, but the results aren't as
pretty. Italic characters are underlined, and there are no bold characters,
although some versions of nroff simulate bold by overstriking.
