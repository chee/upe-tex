files and the instructions to unpack it.

A second insight is that the shell's here documents are a convenient way to
combine a command invocation and the data for the command. The rest of the job
is just getting the quotes right. Here's a working program, called bundle, that
groups the files together into a self-explanatory shell file on its standard
output:

        $ cat bundle
        # bundle: group files into distribution package
        echo '# To unbundle, sh this file'
        for i
        do
                echo "echo $i 1>&2"
                echo "cat >$i <<'End of $i'"
                cat $i
                echo "End of $i"
        done
        $

Quoting "End of $i" ensures that any shell metacharacters in the files will be
ignored.

Naturally, you should try it out before inflicting it on somewhere!bob:

        $ bundle cx lc >junk                    Make a trial bundle
        $ cat junk
        # To unbundle, sh this file
        echo cx 1>&2
        cat >cx <<'End of cx'
        chmod +x cx
        End of cx
        echo lc 1>&2
        cat >lc <<'End of lc'
        # lc: count number of lines in files
        wc -l $*
        End of lc
        $ mkdir test
        $ sh ../junk                            Tr it out
        cx
        lc
        $ ls
        cx
        lc
