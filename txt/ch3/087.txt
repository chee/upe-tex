        $ cat mailinglist               New version
        echo don whr ejs mb
        $ cx mailinglist
        $ mailinglist
        don whr ejs mb
        $

Now mailing the letter to the people on the list becomes

        $ mail `mailinglist` <letter

With the addition of one more program, it's even possible to modify the user
list interactively. The program is called pick:

        $ pick arguments ...

presents the arguments one at a time and waits after each for a response. The
output of pick is those arguments selected by y (for "yes") responses; any other
response causes the argument to be discarded. For example,

        $ pr `pick *.c` | lpr

presents each filename that ends in .c; those selected are printed with pr and
lpr. (pick is not part of the 7th Edition, but it's so easy and useful that
we've included versions of it in Chapter 5 and 6.)

Suppose you have the second version of mailinglist. Then

        $ mail `pick \`mailinglist\`` <letter
        don? y
        whr?
        ejs?
        mb? y
        $

sends the letter to don and mb. Notice that there are nested backquotes; the
backslashes prevent the interpretation of the inner `...` during the parsing of
the outer one.

Exercise 3-10. If the backquotes are omitted in

        $ echo `echo \`date\``

what happens?

Exercise 3-11. Try

        $ `date`

and explain the result.

Exercise 3-12.

        $ grep -l pattern filenames

lists the filenames in which there was a match of pattern, but produces no other
output. Try some variations on
