        $ pr file | lpr &

arranges to print the file on the line printer without making you wait for the
command to finish. Parenthesizing the pipeline has the same effect, but requires
more typing:

        $ (pr file | lpr) &                     Same as last example

Most programs accept arguments on the command line, such as file (an argument to
pr) in the above example. Arguments are words, separated by blanks and tabs,
that typically name files to be processed by the command, but they are strings
that may be interpreted any way the program sees fit. For example, pr accepts
names of the files to print, echo echoes its arguments without interpretation,
and grep's first argument specifies a text pattern to search for. And, of
course, most programs also have options, indicated by arguments beginning with
a minus sign.

The various special characters interpreted by the shell, such as <, >, |, ; and
&, are not arguments to the programs the shell runs. They instead control how
the shell runs them. For example,

        $ echo Hello >junk

tells the shell to run echo with the single argument Hello, and place the output
in the file junk. The string >junk is not an argument to echo; it is interpreted
by the shell and never seen by echo. In fact, it need not be the last string in
the command:

        $ >junk echo hello

is identical, but less obvious.


Exercise 3-1 What are the differences among the following three commands?

    $ cat file | pr
    $ pr <file
    $ pr file

(Over the years the redirection operator < has lost some ground to pipes; people
seem to fine "cat file |" more natural than "<file".)


Metacharacters

The shell recognizes a number of other characters as special; the most commonly
used is the asterisk * which tells the shell to search the directory for
filenames in which any string of characters occurs in the position of the *. For
example,

        $ echo *

is a poor facsimile of ls. Something we didn't mention in Chapter 1 is that the
filename-matching characters do not look at filenames beginning with a
