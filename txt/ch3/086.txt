        $ ls /usr/you/bin | 5
        2             3             4             411           5
        6             cx            cx            cx             nu
        what          where
        $ cat 5
        # 2, 3, ...:  print in n columns
        pr -$0 -t -l1 $*
        $

The -t option turns off the heading at the top of the page and the -ln option
sets the page length to n lines. The name of the program becomes the
number-of-columns argument to pr, so the output is printed a row at a time in
the number of columns specified by $0.


3.5 Program output as arguments

Let us turn now from command arguments within a shell file to the generation of
arguments. Certainly filename expansion from metacharacters like * is the most
common way to generate arguments (other than by providing them explicitly), but
another good way is by running a program. The output of any program can be
placed in a command line by enclosing the invocation in backquotes `...`:

        $ echo At the tone the time will be `date`
        At the tone the time will be Thu Sep 29 00:02:15 EDT 1983.
        $

A small change illustrates that `...` is interpreted inside double quotes "...":

        $ echo "At the tone
        > the time will be `date`."
        At the tone
        the time will be Thu Sep 29 00:03:07 EDT 1983.
        $

As another example, suppose you want to send mail to a list of people whose
login names are in the file mailinglist. A clumsy way to handle this is to edit
mailinglist into a suitable mail command and present it to the shell, but it's
far easier to say

        $ mail `cat mailinglist` <letter

This runs cat to produce the list of user names, and those become the arguments
to mail. (When interpreting output in backquotes as arguments, the shell treats
newlines as word separators, not command-line terminators; this subject is
discussed fully in Chapter 5.) Backquotes are easy enough to use that there's
really no need for a separate mailing-list option to the mail command.

A slightly different approach is to convert the file mailinglist from just a
list of names into a program that prints the list of names:
