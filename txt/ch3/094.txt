The shell jargon for this construction is a here document; it means that the
input is right here instead of in a file somewhere. The << signals the
construction; the word that follows (End in our example) is used to delimit the
input, which is taken to be everything up to an occurrence of that word on a
line by itself. The shell substitutes for $, `...`, and \ in a here document,
unless some part of the word is quoted with quotes or a backslash; in that case,
the whole document is taken literally.

We'll return to here documents are the end the chapter, with a much more
interesting example.

Table 3.2 lists the various input-output redirections that the shell
understands.

Exercise 3-14. Compare the here-document version of 411 with the original. Which
is easier to maintain? Which is a better basis for a general service?

3.8 Looping in shell programs

The shell is actually a programming language: it has variables, loops,
decision-making, and so on. We will discuss basic looping here, and talk more
about control flow in Chapter 5.
