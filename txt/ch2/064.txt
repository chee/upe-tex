execution of a program. When you start up the editor ed, for example, it creates
a file with a name like /tmp/e00512 to hold its copy of the file that you are
editing, rather than working with the original file. It could, of course, create
the file in your current directory, but there are advantages to placing it in
/tmp; although it is unlikely, you might already have a file called e00512 in
your directory; /tmp is cleaned up automatically when the system starts, so your
directory doesn't get an unwanted file if the system crashes; and often /tmp is
arranged on the disc for fast access.
