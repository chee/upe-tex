History and bibliographic notes

The file system forms one part of the discussion in "UNIX implementation," by
ken Thompson (BSTJ, July, 1978). A paper by Dennis Ritchie, entitled "The
evolution of the UNIX time-sharing system" (Symposium on Language Design and
Programming methodology, Sydney, Australia, Sept. 1979) is an fascinating
description of how the file system was designed and implemented on the original
PDP-7 UNIX system, and how it grew into its present form.

The UNIX file system adapts some ideas from the MULTICS file system. The MULTICS
System: An Examination of its Structure, By E. I. Organick (MIT Press, 1972)
provides a comprehensive treatment of MULTICS.

"Password security: a case history," By Bob Morris and Ken Thompson, is an
entertaining comparison of password mechanisms on a variety of systems; it can
be found in Volume 2B of the UNIX Programmer's Manual.

In the same volume, the paper "On the security of UNIX," by Dennis Ritchie,
explains how the security of a system depends more on the care taken with its
administration than with the details of programs like crypt.
