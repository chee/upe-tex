        $ pwd
        /usr/you
        $ mkdir recipes
        $ cd recipes
        $ pwd
        /usr/you/recipes
        $ mkdir pie cookie
        $ ed pie/apple
        ...
        $ ed cookie/choc.chip
        ...
        $

Notice that it is simple to refer to subdirectories. pie/apple has an obvious
meaning: the apple pie recipe, in directory /usr/you/recipes/pie. You could
instead have put the recipe in, say, recipes/apple.pie, rather than in a
subdirectory of recipes, but it seems better organized to put all the pies
together, too. For example, the crust recipe could be kept in recipes/pie/crust
rather than duplicating it in each pie recipe.

Although the file system is a powerful organizational tool, you can forget where
you put a file, or even what files you've got. The obvious solution is a command
or two to rummage around the directories. The ls command is certainly helpful
for finding files, but it doesn't look in sub-directories.

        $ cd
        $ ls
        junk
        recipes
        $ file *
        junk:   ascii text
        recipes:        directory
        $ ls recipes
        cookie
        pie
        $ ls recipes/pie
        apple
        crust
        $
