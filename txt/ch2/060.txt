file point to the same inode, and hence have the same i-number:

        $ ls -li
        total 3
        15768 -rw-rw-rw- 2 you        29 Sep 27 12:07 junk
        15768 -rw-rw-rw- 2 you        29 Sep 27 12:07 linktojunk
        15274 drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $

The integer printed between the permissions and the owner is the number of links
to the file. Because each link just points to the inode, each link is equally
important --- there is no difference between the first link and subsequent ones.
(Notice that the total disc space computed by ls is wrong because of double
counting.)

When you change a file, access to the file by any of its names will reveal the
changes, since all the links point to the same file.

        $ echo x >junk
        $ ls -l
        total 3
        -rw-rw-rw- 2 you         2 Sep 27 12:37 junk
        -rw-rw-rw- 2 you         2 Sep 27 12:37 linktojunk
        drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $ rm linktojunk
        $ ls -l
        total 3
        -rw-rw-rw- 2 you         2 Sep 27 12:37 junk
        drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $

After linktojunk is removed the link count goes back to one. As we said
before. rm'ing a file just breaks a link; the file remains until the last link
is removed. In practice, of course, most files only have one link, but again we
see a simple idea providing great flexibility.

A word to the hasty: once the last link to a file is gone, the data is
irretrievable. Deleted files go into the incinerator, rather than the waste
basket, and there is no way to call them back from the ashes. (There is a faint
hope of resurrection. Most large UNIX systems have a formal backup procedure
that periodically copies changed files to some safe place like magnetic tape,
from which they can be retrieved. For your own protection and peace of mind, you
should know just how much backup is provided on your system. If there is none,
watch out --- some mishap to the discs could be a catastrophe.)

Links to files are handy when two people wish to share a file, but sometimes you
really want a separate copy --- a different file with the same information. You
might copy a document before making extensive changes to it, for example, so you
can restore the original if you decide you don't like the changes. Make a link
wouldn't help, because when the data changed, both
