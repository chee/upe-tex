junk is a file with 36 bytes --- the 36 characters you typed while appending
(except, of course, for correction of any typing mistakes). To see the file,

        $ cat junk
        now is the time
        for all good people
        $ 

cat shows what the file looks like. The command od (octal dump) prints a visible
representation of all the bytes of a file:

        $ od -c junk
        0000000   n   o   w       i   s       t   h   e       t   i   m   e  \n
        0000020   f   o   r       a   l   l       g   o   o   d       p   e   o
        0000040   p   l   e  \n
        0000044
        $ 

the -c option means "interpret bytes as characters." Turning on the -b option
will show the bytes as octal (base 8) numbers+ as well:

        $ od -cb junk
        0000000   n   o   w       i   s       t   h   e       t   i   m   e  \n

----------------
+Each byte in a file contains a number large enough to encode a printable
character. The encoding on most UNIX systems is called ASCII (American Standard
Code for Information Interchange), but some machines, particularly those
manufactured by IBM, use an encoding called EBCDIC(Extended Binary-Coded-Decimal
Interchange Code). Throughout this book, we will assume the ASCII encoding; cat
/usr/pub/ascii or read ascci(7) to see the octal values of the characters.
