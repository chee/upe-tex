        m+                  Move current line to after next one (interchange)
        m-2                 Move current line to before previous one
        m--                 Same: -- is the same as -2
        m-                  Does nothing
        m$                  Move current line to end (m0 moves to beginning)
        t.                  Duplicate current line(t$ duplicates at end)
        -,.t.               Duplicate previous and current lines
        1,$t$               Duplicate entire set of lines
        g/^/m0              Reverse order of lines


Marks and line numbers

The command = prints the line number of line $ (a poor default), .= prints the
number of the current line, and so on. Dot is unchanged.

The command kc marks the addressed line with the lower case letter c; the line
can subsequently be addressed as 'c. The k command does not change dot. Marks
are convenient for moving large chunks of text, since they remain permanently
attached to lines, as in this sequence:

        /.../ka             Find line ... and mark with a
        /.../kb             Find line ... and mark with b
        'a,'bp              Print entire range to be sure
        /.../               Find target line
        'a,'bm              Move selected lines after it


Joining, splitting and rearranging lines

Lines can be joined with the j command (no blanks are added):

        m,nj                Join lines m through n into one line

The default range is .,.+1, so

        jp                  Join current line to next and print
        -,.jp               Join previous line to current and print

Lines can be split with the substitute command by quoting a newline:

        s/part1part2/part1\ Split line into two parts
        part2/                ...
        s/ /\               Split at each blank;
        /g                    makes one word per line

Dot is left at the last line created.

To talk about parts of the matched regular expression, not just the whole thing,
use tagged regular expressions: If the construction \(...\) appears in a regular
expression, the part of the whole that it matches is available on both the right
hand side and the left as \1. There can be up to nine tagged regular
expressions, referred to as \1, \2, etc.
