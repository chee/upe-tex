Escape to the shell with !

If you are running ed, you can escape temporarily to run another shell command;
there's no need to quit. The ed command to do this is '!':

        $ ed poem
        263
        !wc poem                    Run wc without leaving ed
              8     46     263 poem
        !                           You have returned from the command
        q                           Quit without w is OK: no change was made
        $


Printing

The lines of the file are numbered 1, 2, ...; you can print the n-th line by
giving the command np or just the number n, and lines m through n with m,np. The
"line number" $ is the last line, so you don't have to count lines.

        1                           Print 1st line: same as 1p
        $                           Print last line; same as $p
        1,$p                        print lines 1 through last

You can print a file one line at a time just by pressing RETURN; you can back up
one line at a time with '-'. Line numbers can be combined with + and -.

        $-2,$p                      Print last 3 lines
        1,2+3p                      Print lines 1 through 5

But you can't print past the end or in reverse order; commands like $,$+1p and
$,1p are illegal.

The list command l prints in a format that makes all characters visible; it's
good for finding control characters in files, for distinguishing blanks from
tabs, and so on. (See vis in Chapter 6.)


Patterns

Once a file becomes longer than a few lines, it's a bother to have to print it
all to find a particular line, so ed provides a way to search for lines that
match a particular pattern: /pattern/ finds the next occurrence of pattern.

        $ ed poem
        263
        /flea/                      Search for next line containing flea
        Great fleas have little fleas
        /flea/                      Search for next one
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,
        //                          Search for next using same pattern
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
        ??                          Search backwards for same pattern
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,

ed remembers the pattern you used last, so you can repeat a search with just
