//. To search backwards, use ?pattern? and ??.

Searches with /.../ and ?...? "wrap around" at either end of the text:

        $p                          Print last line. ('p' is optional)
          and greater still, and so on.
        /flea/                      Next flea is near beginning
        Great fleas have little fleas
        ??                          Wrap around beginning going backwards
          have greater fleas to go on;

A pattern search like /flea/ is a line number just as 1 or $ is, and can be used
in the same contexts:

        1,/flea/p                   Print from 1 to next flea
        ?flea?+1,$p                 Print from previous flea +1 to end


Where are we anyway?

ed keeps track of the last line where you did something: printing or adding text
or reading a file. The name of this line is '.'; it is pronounced "dot" and is
called the current line. Each command has a defined effect on dot, usually
setting it to the last line affected by the command. You can use dot in the same
way that you use $ or a number like 1:

        $ ed poem
        263
        .                           Print current line; same as $ after reading
          and greater still, and so on.
        .-1,.p                      Print previous line and this one
        While these again have greater still,
          and greater still, and so on.

Line number expressions can be abbreviated:

        Shorthand:  Same as:                Shorthand:  Same as:
        -           .-1                     +           .+1
        -- or -2    .-2                     ++ or +2    .+2
        -n          .-n                     +n          .+n
        $-          $-1                     .3          .+3


Append, change, delete, insert

The append command a adds lines after the specified line; the delete command d
deletes lines; the insert command i inserts lines before the specified line; the
change command c changes lines, a combination of delete and insert.

        na                        Add text after line n
        ni                        Insert text before line n
        m,nd                      Delete lines m through n
        m,nc                      change lines m through n

If no line numbers are given, dot is used. The new text for a, c and i
