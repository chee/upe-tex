can be preceded by one or two line numbers, which indicate what line or lines
are to be affected by the command; a default line number is used otherwise. Line
numbers can be specified by absolute position in the file (1, 2, ...), by
shorthand like $ for the last line and '.' for the current line, by pattern
searches using regular expressions, and by additive combinations of these.

Let us review how to create files with ed, using De Morgan's poem from Chapter
1.

        $ ed poem
        ?poem                       Warning: the file poem doesn't exit
        a                           Start adding lines
        Great fleas have little fleas
          upon their backs to bite 'em,
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,
          and so ad infinitum.
        .                           Type a '.' to stop adding
        w poem                      Write lines to file poem
        121                         ed reports 121 characters written
        q                           Quit.
        $

The command a adds or appends lines; the appending mode is terminated by a line
with a '.' by itself. There is no indication of which mode you are in, so two
common mistakes to watch for are typing text without an a command, and typing
commands before typing the '.'.

ed will never write your text into a file automatically; you have to tell it to
do so with the w command. If you try to quit without writing your changes,
however, ed prints a ? as a warning. At that point, another q command will let
you exit without writing. Q always quits regardless of changes.

        $ ed poem
        121                         File exists, and has 121 characters
        a                           Add some more lines at the end
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
          have greater fleas to go on;
        While these again have greater still,
          and greater still, and so on.
        .                           Type a '.' to stop adding
        q                           Try to quit
        ?                           Warning: you didn't write first
        w                           No filename given; poem is assumed
        263
        q                           Now it's OK to quit
        $ wc poem                   Check for sure
              8     46     263 poem
        $
