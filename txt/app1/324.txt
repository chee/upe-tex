        s/big/very &/       Replace big by very big
        s/big/& &/          Replace big by big big.
        s/.*/(&)/           Parenthesize entire line (see .* below)
        s/and/\&/           Replace and by & (\ turns off special meaning)


Metacharacters and regular expressions

In the same way that characters like * and > and | have special meaning to the
shell, certain characters have special meaning to ed when they appear in a
search pattern or in the left-hand part of an s command. Such characters are
called metacharacters, and the patterns that use them are called regular
expressions. Table 1 lists the characters and their meanings; the examples below
should be read in conjunction with the table. The special meaning of any
character can be turned off by preceding it with a backslash.
