History and bibliographic notes

The standard I/O library was designed by Dennis Ritchie, after Mike Lesk's
portable I/O library. The intent of both packages was to provide enough standard
facilities that programs could be moved form UNIX to non-UNIX systems without
change.

Our design of p is based on a program by Henry Spencer.

adb was written by Steve Bourne, sdb by Howard Katseff, and lint by Steve
Johnson.

idiff is loosed based on program originally written by Joe Maranzano. diff
itself is by Doug McIlroy, and is based on an algorithm invented independently
by Harold Stone and by Wayne Hunt and Tom Szymanski. (See "A fast algorithm for
computing longest common subsequences," by J. W. Hunt and T. G. Szymanski, CACM,
may, 1977.) The idff algorithm is described in M. D. McIlroy and J. W. Hunt, "An
algorithm for differential file comparison," Bell Labs Computing Science
Technical Report 41, 1976. To quote McIlroy, "I had tried at least three
completely different algorithms before the final one. diff is a quintessential
case of not settling for mere competency in a program but revising it until it
was right."
