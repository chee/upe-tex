
The function ret pops the arguments off the stack, restores the frame pointer
fp, and sets the program counter.


   Several of the interpreter routines need minor fiddling to handle the situa-
tion when a return occurs in a nested statement. This is done inelegantly but
adequately by a flag called returning, which is true when a return state-
ment has been seen. ifcode, whilecode and execute terminate early if
returning is set; call resets it to zero.
