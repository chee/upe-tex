Execution of the machine is simple; in fact, it's rather neat how small the
routine is that "runs" the machine once it's set up:


Each cycle executes the function pointed to by the instruction pointed to by the
program counter pc, and increments pc so it's ready for the next instruction.
An instruction with opcode STOP terminates the loop. Some instructions, such
as constpush and varpush, also increment pc to step over any arguments
that follow the instruction.


The rest of the machine is easy. For instance, the arithmetic operations are all
basically the same, and were created by editing a single prototype. Here is add:
