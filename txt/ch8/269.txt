beginning of the code for the condition. After the whole while statement has
been recognized, the two extra positions reserved after the whilecode
instruction are filled with the locations of the loop body and the statement
that follows the loop. (Code for that statement will be generated next.)

$1 is the location in the machine at which whilecode is stored; therefore,
($1)[1] and ($1)[2] are the next two positions.

A picture might make this clearer:


The situation for an if is similar, except that three spots are reserved, for
the then and else parts and the statement that follows the if. We will return

Lexical analysis is somewhat longer this time, mainly to pick up the additional
operators:
