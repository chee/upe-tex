This also illustrates the use of files: the filename "-" is the standard input.

   Here is a factorial function:


Arguments are referenced within a function or procedure as $1, etc., as in the
shell, but it is legal to assign to them as well. Functions and procedures are
recursive, but only the arguments are local variables; all other variables are
global, that is, accessible throughout the program.

hoc distinguishes functions from procedures because doing so gives a level of

There are a fair number of changes to the grammar to convert hoc5 into hoc6, but
they are localized. New tokens and non-terminals are needed, and the %union
declaration has a new member to hold argument counts:
