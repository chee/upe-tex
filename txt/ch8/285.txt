
measured by time. It is also possible to instrument a C program to determine
how much of that time each function uses. The program must be recompiled
with profiling turned on, by adding the option -p to each C compilation and
load. If we modify the makefile to read


so that the cc command uses the variable CFLAGS, and then say


the resulting program will contain the profiling code. When the program runs,
it will leave a file called mon.out of data that is interpreted by the program
prof.

   To illustrate these notions briefly, we made a test on hoc6 with the
Fibonacci program above.


   The measurements obtained from profiling are just as subject to chance
fluctuations as are those from time, so they should be treated as indicators,
not absolute truth. The numbers here do suggest how to make hoc faster,
however, if it needs to be. About one third of the run time is going into
