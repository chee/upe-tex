To make the discussion concrete, we'll use a file called poem that contains a
familiar verse by Augustus De Morgan. Let's create it with ed:

        $ ed
        a
        Great fleas have little fleas
          upon their backs to bite 'em,
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,
          and so ad infinitum.
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
          have greater fleas to go on;
        While these again have greater still,
          and greater still, and so on.
        .
        w poem
        263
        q
        $

The first command counts the lines, words and characters in one or more files;
it is named wc after its word-counting function:

        $ wc poem
              8     46     263 poem
        $ 

That is, poem has 8 lines, 46 words, and 263 characters. The definition of a
"word" is very simple: any string of characters that doesn't contain a blank tab
or newline.

wc will count more than one file for you (and print the totals), and it will
also suppress any of the counts if requested. See wc(1).

The second command is called grep; it searches files for lines that match a
pattern. (The name comes from the ed command g/regular-expression/p, which is
explained in Appendix 1.) Suppose you want to look for the word "fleas" in poem:

        $ grep fleas poem
        Great fleas have little fleas
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
          have greater fleas to go on;
        $ 

grep will also look for lines that don't match the pattern, when the option -v
is used. (It's named 'v' after the editor command; you can think of it as
inverting the sense of the match.)
