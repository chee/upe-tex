pr can also produce multi-column output:

        pr -3 filenames

prints each file in 3-column format. You can get any reasonable number in place
of "3" and pr will do its best. (The word filenames is a place-holder for a list
of names of files.) pr -m will print a set of files in parallel columns. See
pr(1).

It should be noted that pr is not a formatting program in the sense of
rearranging lines and justifying margins. The true formatters are nroff and
troff, which are discussed in Chapter 9.

There are also commands that print files on a high-speed printer. Look in your
manual under names line lp and lpr, or look up "printer" in the permuted
index. Which to use depends on what equipment is attached to your machine. pr
and lpr are often used together; after pr formats the information properly, lpr
handles the mechanics of getting it to the line printer. We will return to this
a little later.


Moving, copying, removing files --- mv, cp, rm

Let's look at some other commands. The first thing is to change the name of a
file. Renaming a file is done by "moving" it from one name to another, like
this:

        $ mv junk precious

This means that the file that used to be called junk is now called precious;
that contents are unchanged. If you run ls now, you will see a different list:
junk is not there but precious is.
