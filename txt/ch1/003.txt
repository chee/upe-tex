advances the cursor to the next tab stop, much as on a regular typewriter. Tab
stops on UNIX systems are eight spaces apart. Both the backspaces and tab
characters have their keys on the terminals.

Two other keys have special meaning: DELETE, sometimes called RUBOUT or some
abbreviation, and BREAK, sometimes called INTERRUPT. On most UNIX systems, the
DELETE key stops a program immediately, without waiting for it to finish. On
some systems, ctl-c provides this device. And on some systems, depending on how
the terminals are connected, BREAK is a synonym for DELETE or ctl-c.


A Session with UNIX

Let's begin with an annotated dialog between you and your UNIX system.
Throughout the examples in this book, what you type is printed in slanted
letters, computer responses are in typewriter-style characters, and explanations
are in italics.

        Establish a connection: dial a phone or turn on a switch as necessary.
        Your system should say
        login: you                 Type your name, then press RETURN
        Password:                  Your password won't be echoed as you type it
        You have mail.             There's mail to be read after you log in
        $                          The system is now ready for your commands
        $                          Press RETURN a couple of times
        $ date                     What is the date and time?
        Sun Sep 25 23:02:57 EDT 1983
        $ who                      Who's using the computer?
        jlb      ttyO    Sep 25 13:59
        you      tty2    Sep 25 23:01
        mary     tty4    Sep 25 19:03
        doug     tty5    Sep 25 19:22
        egb      tty7    Sep 25 17:17
        bob      tty8    Sep 25 20:48
        $ mail                     Read your mail
        From doug Sun Sep 25 20:53 EDT 1983
        give me a call sometime monday

        ?                          RETURN moves on to the next message
        From mary Sun Sep 25 19:07 EDT 1983     Next message

        ? d                        Delete this message
        $                          No more mail
        $ mail mary                Send mail to mary
        lunch at 12 is fine
        ctl-d                      End of mail
        $                          Hang up phone or turn off terminal
                                   and that's the end

Sometimes that's all there is to a session, though occasionally people do
