        $ tail -1 poem
          and greater still, and so on.
        $ 

tail can also be used to print a file starting at a specified line:

        $ tail +3 filename

starts printing with the 3rd line. (Notice the natural inversion of the minus
sign convention for arguments.)

The final pair of commands is for comparing files. Suppose that we have a
variant of poem in the file new_poem:

        $ cat poem
        Great fleas have little fleas
          upon their backs to bite 'em,
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,
          and so ad infinitum.
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
          have greater fleas to go on;
        While these again have greater still,
          and greater still, and so on.
        $ cat new_poem
        Great fleas have little fleas
          upon their backs to bite them,
        And little fleas have lesser fleas,
          and so so ad infinitum.
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
          have greater fleas to go on;
        While these again have greater still,
          and greater still, and so on.
        $ 

There's not much difference between the two files; in fact you'll have to look
hard to find it. This is where file comparison commands come in handy. cmp finds
the first place where two files differ:

        $ cmp poem new_poem
        poem new_poem differ: char 58, line 2
        $ 

This says that the files are different in the second line, which is true enough,
but it doesn't say what the difference is, nor does it identify any difference
beyond the first.

The other file comparison command is diff, which reports on all lines that are
changed, added or deleted:
