ignored, press RETURN; something should happen. RETURN won't be mentioned again,
but you need it at the end of every line.

The next command to try is who, which tells you everyone who is currently logged
in:

        $ who
        rim     tty0     Sep 26 11:37
        pjw     tty4     Sep 26 11:30
        gerard  tty7     Sep 26 10:27
        mark    tty9     Sep 26 07:59
        you     ttya     Sep 26 12:20
        $

The first column is the user name. The second is the system's name for the
connection being used ("tty" stands for "teletype," an archaic synonym for
"terminal"). The rest tells when the user logged on. You might also try

        $ who am i
        you     ttya     Sep 26 12:20
        $

If you make a mistake typing the name of a command, and refer to a non-existent
command, you will be told that no command of that name can be found:

        $ whom                     Misspelled command name ...    
        whom: not found            ... so system didn't know how to run it
        $

Of course, if you inadvertently type the name of an actual command, it will run,
perhaps with mysterious results.


Strange terminal behavior

Sometimes your terminal will act strangely, for example, each letter may be
typed twice, or RETURN may not put the cursor at the first column of the next
line. You can usually fix this by turning the terminal off and on, or by logging
out and logging back in. Or you can read the description of the command stty
("set terminal options") in Section 1 of the manual. To get intelligent
treatment of tab characters if your terminal doesn't have tabs, type the command

        $ stty -tabs

and the system will convert tabs into the right number of spaces. If your
terminal does have computer-settable tab stops, the command tabs will set them
correctly for you. (You may actually have to say

        $ tabs terminal-type

to make it work --- see the tabs command description in the manual.)
