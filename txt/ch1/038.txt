        TERM=adm3

to your .profile file.

It is also possible to use variables for abbreviation. If you find yourself
frequently referring to some directory with long name, it might be worthwhile
adding a line like

        d=/horribly/long/directory/name

to your profile, so that you can say things like

        $ cd $d

Personal variables like d are conventionally spelled in lower case to
distinguish them from those used by the shell itself, like PATH.

Finally, it's necessary to tell the shell that you intend to use the variables
in other programs; this is done with the command export, to which we will return
in Chapter 3:

        export MAIL PATH TERM

To summarize, here is what a typical .profile file might look like:

	$ cat .profile
	stty erase '^h' -tabs
	MAIL=/usr/spool/mail/you
	PATH=:$HOME/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/games
	TERM=adm3
	b=$HOME/book
	export MAIL PATH TERM b
	date
	who | wc -l
	$

We have by no means exhausted the services that the shell provides. One of the
most useful is that yo can create your own commands by packaging existing
commands into a file to be processed by the shell. It is remarkable how much can
be achieved by this fundamentally simple mechanism. Our discussion of it begins
in Chapter 3.



1.5 The rest of the UNIX system

There's much more to the UNIX system than we've addressed in this chapter, but
then there's much more to this book. By now, you should feel comfortable with
the system and, particularly, with the manual. When you have specific questions
about when or how to use commands, the manual is the place to look.

It is also worth browsing in the manual occasionally, to refresh your knowledge
of familiar commands and to discover new ones. The manual describes many
programs we won't illustrate, including compilers for languages
